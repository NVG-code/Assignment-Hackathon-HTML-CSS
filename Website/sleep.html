                        Importance of a Consistent Wake Time
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        The first challenge may seem inconsequential, but it typically yields results quickly: Wake up at the same time every day, including weekends or days off. Ideally, you would be able to sleep as much as you need to and wouldn't wake with an alarm clock, but to begin with, you can use one.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You should select a wake-up time that you can observe every day, including weekdays and weekends. For most people, this would mean selecting a time that would allow you to get to work or school during the week and then getting up at the same time on Saturday and Sunday. Once you have selected your wake time, consider whether it is feasible. This isn't about making yourself an early bird if you start out as a night owl.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Though society may pressure you into believing that waking earlier is somehow better—more moral, reflective of a hard-working nature, etc.—what evidence is there for this? Plenty of successful people stay up until 2 a.m. and sleep in until 10 a.m., so don't fall into that trap. Consider your own body and your own needs. Pick a wake-up time that you can maintain and don't let it be too early or inconsistent with your typical, natural pattern in the recent past.
