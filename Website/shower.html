                        Known benefits of cold showers
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        Thousands of people from all over the world already incorporate cold showers into their daily routines. The main benefits reported by people who take cold showers regularly are listed below:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Reduced stress levels. Regularly taking cold showers imposes a small amount of stress on your body, which leads to a process called hardening. This means that your nervous system gradually gets used to handling moderate levels of stress. The hardening process helps you to keep a cool head, the next time you find yourself in a stressful situation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Higher level of alertness. Cold showers wake your body up, inducing a higher state of alertness. The cold also stimulates you to take deeper breaths, decreasing the level of CO2 throughout the body, helping you concentrate. Cold showers thus keep you ready and focused throughout the day.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Increased willpower. It takes a strong mind to endure the cold for extended periods of time. By incorporating cold showers into your daily routine, you are strengthening your willpower, which benefits many aspects of (your) daily life.
