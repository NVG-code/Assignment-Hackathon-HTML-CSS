                        The Importance of Morning Sunlight
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        They say the best things in life are free, and morning sunlight is no exception. Our bodies thrive when well-nourished, and similar to when we eat healthily and feel great, sunlight can work comparable wonders. We're biologically wired to sync up with the sun.

                        Our bodies produce melatonin when the sun goes down to help us sleep and then reduces the chemical when the sun comes up. Many of us dismiss getting outside as a luxury, putting it off to work longer hours or recharge in front of the TV. However, research suggests that sunlight could help you recharge more effectively, work more efficiently, and feel better as a result.

                        Morning sunshine isn't just lovely to look at; the sun's rays provide biological benefits which are essential to your functionality, many of which may hold the key to making your life healthier, easier, and more enjoyable. For example, sunlights vitamin D[1] is a critical component to fighting fatigue, boosting mental health, and could even help rejuvenate aging eyes and maintain a healthy weight. Sunlight is even known to enhance sleep patterns, and ease mild depression.
