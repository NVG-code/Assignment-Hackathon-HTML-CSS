                        Morning exercise has many health benefits. If you have a hard time sticking to a routine, move your workout to the first part of the day. The following five benefits might just outweigh the earlier wake-up call. “Morning workouts help reduce the possibility for obstacles to present themselves,” Jasmin Theard, ACSM HFS, an exercise physiologist at Piedmont Atlanta Fitness Center. “There is also less opportunity to make excuses.”

                        There are many mental health benefits of exercise, and working out first thing helps you experience those benefits right away. “Exercise leads to the secretion of neurotransmitters that promote mental clarity and an improved attention span,” she says. “You’ll feel a sense of accomplishment, as well as rejuvenated and recharged.” That early morning sense of accomplishment can also help you have a healthier day. “When you get up and exercise, you establish a healthier mindset, which makes you more mindful of what you eat during the day,” she explains.

                        Exercise has also been shown to boost metabolism. While no study definitively proves that exercising in the morning increases your metabolism more than other times of the day, it does help to ensure you squeeze it in. “Exercise in general helps create a hormonal balance and helps you get into a routine, which can help improve your sleep,” she says. Exercise and sleep go hand in hand because getting enough sleep is also linked to weight loss.
